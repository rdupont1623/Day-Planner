Day Planner - Project 5

This project was a lot of work but a lot of fun. It took me a while to get used to implementing jQuery, now that I have a better sense of it I see why its so important and
people use it so much. Local Storage was pretty intimidating at first, but after a while it started to make a lot of sense, it's actually a very neat tool. 

I had some fun and made a birthday calculator, it doesn't work perfectly, but I threw it on here for good measure.
